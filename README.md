# A GUI for vsftpd configurations developed in JavaFX

This is a GUI for vsftpd to change the most frequently used configurations.

It's developed and tested in ubuntu 18.04LTS and deepin 20, both of them are debian distributions. It can also run correctly in most debian distributions. If you use other distributions like centos, the location of configuration file may differ (because vsftpd's configuration file is installed in different locations when using apt or yum to install) and you may need to change the shell script to find it.

To run the jar file,you should install JDK or JRE >=1.8,both oracle one and openjdk are OK. To edit or compiler the source code, you should install oracle JDK1.8 or openjfx first
